## Authentication API

The backend was built to be able to take two POST requests, one to login and one to register.

Users details are stored in a MongoDB database.

I have used Bcrypt to hash the passwords for added security.

## Run npm start

Run 'npm start' to activate the server which runs on port 5000.

## Built using:

Express.js
Node.js
Mongoose
MongoDB
Nodemon
dotenv
Bcrypt
